This project focuses on extracting essential data from a stock dataset and displaying it in a graph. The extracted data and visualization provide valuable insights for data analysis and decision-making in the field of finance.

## Description

Extracting and visualizing stock data is a fundamental task in data science, enabling individuals to make informed decisions based on the available data. This project aims to extract stock data from a reliable data source and present it using a graph visualization.

The project consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: The stock data is obtained from a dataset or a web API. This project assumes that the data is already available in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

2. **Data Processing**: The extracted data is pre-processed to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This may involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for visualization.

3. **Data Visualization**: The pre-processed stock data is visualized using graphs or charts. Commonly used graph types for stock data visualization include line graphs, candlestick charts, and bar charts. The visualization should provide a clear representation of the stock data, including price trends, volume, and any other relevant parameters.
